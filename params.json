It is meant as a tool for developers to easily see what step definitions already exist.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported output formats include HTML and Confluence wiki markup.  The documentation can be pushed into a wiki using the [Confluence Publisher Plugin] [cpp] for Jenkins.  Adding outputters for other formats is straightforward.\r\n\r\n  [cpp]: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Confluence+Publisher+Plugin\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nAssuming you installed with Bundler:\r\n\r\n> bundle exec cuke-steps \\[options\\] &lt;directories...&gt;\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form:\r\n\r\n> bundle exec cuke-steps features/\r\n\r\nSupported options:\r\n\r\n*  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT  \r\n   Select output format, either \"html\" or \"cf\"\r\n\r\n*  -o FILE, --output FILE  \r\n   Output to FILE, default \"steps.html\" or \"steps.cf\"\r\n\r\n*  -h, --help  \r\n   Usage instructions\r\n\r\nThis will scan the provided directories for step definition files (*.rb) and output the documentation in the specified file.\r\n\r\nThe tool supports having step definitions in multiple directories.  It will generate a separate section for each directory specified on the command line, and (if multiple directories are provided) a section containing all step definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n----\r\n\r\n*  Add options for defining a base URL prefix and postfix, and make the file names in the output link to a source repo or Jenkins workspace\r\n\r\n\r\nBSD License\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Sampo Niskanen\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1.
